# Second-Hand Marketplace Platform
## A Cloud-Native Second-Hand Marketplace on AWS

## 1. Executive Summary

Second-Hand Marketplace Platform is a cloud-based web application that enables users to buy and sell second-hand products through a centralized online marketplace. The system provides user authentication, product management, image uploading, searching, and category management while utilizing AWS cloud services to ensure scalability, availability, and simplified deployment.

The application is developed using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **MongoDB Atlas**, and **EJS**, while the infrastructure is deployed on **Amazon ECS Fargate** behind an **Application Load Balancer**. Docker containers are stored in **Amazon ECR**, product images are stored in **Amazon S3**, and **AWS CodeBuild** automatically builds and deploys the application whenever new code is pushed to GitHub. The architecture provides automatic deployment, centralized storage, and cost-effective cloud infrastructure suitable for small and medium-sized e-commerce applications.

# 2. Problem Statement

### Current Problem

Many second-hand marketplaces rely on social media platforms or manually managed websites, making product management inefficient and difficult to maintain. Images are often stored locally, deployments require manual updates, and scaling the application becomes challenging as the number of users increases. Traditional deployment also increases downtime and operational effort whenever new features or bug fixes are released.

### Solution

The proposed solution builds a cloud-native second-hand marketplace platform using AWS managed services.

Users can register accounts, log in securely, upload products with images, browse products by category, search products, and manage their listings through a web application. Product information is stored in MongoDB Atlas, while uploaded product images are stored in Amazon S3.

The application is containerized using Docker and deployed on Amazon ECS Fargate. AWS CodeBuild automatically detects new commits from GitHub, builds a Docker image, pushes it to Amazon ECR, and triggers Amazon ECS to deploy the latest version without manual intervention.

### Benefits and Return on Investment

The platform significantly reduces deployment time through automated CI/CD while improving system scalability and reliability. Developers only need to push source code to GitHub, and the entire deployment process is handled automatically. The cloud architecture also minimizes server management tasks and provides a strong foundation for future expansion. During development, AWS Free Tier and AWS Academy credits help reduce operational costs.

# 3. Solution Architecture

The application follows a cloud-native container architecture using AWS managed services.

# 6. Budget Estimation

## Infrastructure Cost Estimate

| AWS Service | Estimated Cost |
|-------------|----------------|
| Amazon ECS Fargate | AWS Free Tier / AWS Academy Credits |
| Amazon ECR | Minimal |
| Amazon S3 | Low |
| AWS CodeBuild | AWS Free Tier |
| Application Load Balancer | Low |
| Amazon CloudWatch | Minimal |

### Estimated Development Cost

The project utilizes AWS Free Tier and AWS Academy credits during development, resulting in minimal infrastructure costs while providing a production-ready cloud environment.

### Cost Control Guidelines

- Configure AWS Budgets for billing alerts.
- Remove unused ECS tasks.
- Delete unused Docker images in Amazon ECR.
- Configure Amazon S3 Lifecycle Rules.
- Monitor CloudWatch metrics regularly.

# 7. Risk Assessment

## Risk Matrix

- ECS deployment failure.
- MongoDB Atlas connectivity issues.
- Amazon S3 upload failures.
- Unexpected AWS service charges.

## Mitigation Strategies

- Enable Amazon CloudWatch monitoring.
- Configure AWS Budgets alerts.
- Version Docker images using Amazon ECR.
- Perform regular MongoDB Atlas backups.
- Apply IAM least privilege policies.

## Contingency Plans

- Roll back to the previous Docker image.
- Redeploy the previous ECS Task Definition.
- Restore MongoDB Atlas backups.
- Redeploy through AWS CodeBuild.
